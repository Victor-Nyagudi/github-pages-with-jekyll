August 4th, 1968. Tyler blew warm air into his cupped hands as the waves gently rocked the boat back and forth. Justin and Rob barely made it through the storm. 
_I'm one hell of a survivor to make it through that shitshow_. He got up and searched the ship... or whatever the storm had left them with. Aside from a case of wine, 
some pots and pans, and luckily, a lighter, not much made it through. He grabbed the case and jumped down to the glistening sand below the moonlit sky.

"Did you find anything, Ty?" Rob shouted in the distance.

"Barely. A couple of drinks, some cooking stuff, and a lighter," Tyler replied. 

"Hey, at least we have something to take the edge off as we wait for help."

Tyler stared at the gash on his left arm. _It's gonna take a lot more than this to take the edge off._
